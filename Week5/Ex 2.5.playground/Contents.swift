/* Write a function that takes two numbers and calculates the sum of all numbers in that range (inclusive). Use if-else to handle different range cases.
 Instructions:
 Define a function called sumInRange that accepts two integers start and end.
 Use a for loop to iterate from start to end.
 Calculate the sum of the numbers in that range.
 Use if-else to check if the start is greater than end and return an appropriate message.

 Example Input: 3, 6
 Example Output: 18 (because 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18) */
